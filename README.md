# Maze game built with Maven

Introduction:<br />
Our game, namely “DA ONE PIECE”, combines elements of strategy, adventure and combat.<br />
Players will embark on a journey through a visually stunning 2D world where they will have to<br />
discover the secrets of the “ONE PIECE”.<br />


Objective:<br />
The game will thematically feature a pirate setting, where the goal will be for<br />
the user to escape the maze and collect all the rewards on the board. The player will win by<br />
collecting all the rewards and reaching the “exit” cell. Along the way, the player may encounter<br />
enemy zombies/marines and face various punishments that deduct their rewards. The player will<br />
lose when they run out of rewards.<br />
During the project, we as a team decided to meet at least once a week in-person/online to<br />
plan for distinct phases of the project. Our main aim is to successfully build a smoothly running<br />
game and meet all the requirements of the client.<br />


Implementation Plans:<br />
Technically, we will be implemented using object-oriented principles. Our implementation<br />
will feature abstract classes, inheritance, interfaces, and composition. Our program will also<br />
feature a variety of data structures. Thus far, we have planned for the use of a decision tree that<br />
will determine enemy movement, a linked list to keep track of both enemies and items, a 2D array<br />
to implement our collision logic, and finally an overlapping 2D array used for map generation.<br />


How will our customized game stand out?<br />
Our customized game will implement the newest generative AI technology, during the<br />
play-through, the player will have the opportunity to chat with the chatbot namely, Monkey D<br />
Luffy chatbot. There will also be different themed “islands” with unique enemies, traps, and<br />
mysteries to uncover. Follow along Monkey D Luffy, avoiding the navy and other adversaries,<br />
staying out of jail, and find the legendary “ONE PIECE”!<br />
